# Website
Personal website for me where I can test and learn new coding languages and framework. 

Currently I am working on the landing page and on a geographical game involving guessing different countries.

A similar game is available online (countryle.com) and functions similaryly to what I am going to be making (with some minor tweaks)

    * On launch, the website will pick out a random country and the user will try to guess it.
    * If wrong, hints (population, location, continent) will show up that will compare the input and target countries. 
        * For example: If the target country is Brazil and you entered USA, then the following hints will show up:
            Population: Lower (with displayed number)  | Location: South (Coordiantes Probably)| Continent: North America (Colour will be Red since its wrong)
